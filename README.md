# Automagical-R-Script-Plotting
# This script automatically creates a bunch of relevant plots based on the type of data you enter
# First it automatically detects your file's delimiter (tab or comma) and whether it has a header
# Then it categorizes each column by the type of data contained in the column
# And finally it makes a bunch of plots fitting each column and combinations of different columns
